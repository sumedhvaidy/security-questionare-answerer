## 💡 PRO TIPS FOR RECORDING

1. **Practice 3x** before recording — timing is tight at 60 seconds
2. **Use screen recording** with system audio off
3. **Record voiceover separately** for cleaner audio
4. **Mouse movements**: Slow and deliberate, easy to follow
5. **Pause briefly** on impressive visuals (tesseract, results stats)
6. **Energy**: Keep voice upbeat but professional
7. **Speed**: Slightly faster than conversational — you have 60 seconds!
